## API

Right now, these are the supported methods:

*   `PUT /<table_name>`: create a new table named `table_name`.

    The payload must contain the proposed table schema in the form of a JSON list of values. Example:

    `["id", "timestamp", "test_field"]`

*   `POST /<table_name>`: insert a new record into the table name `table_name` or edit an existing record.

    The payload must contain the record data in the form of a JSON key-value pair list. Example:
    
    `[{"id": 1, "timestamp": 1289145623708, "test_field": "the brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"}]`

*   `DELETE /<table_name>`: delete the table named `table_name`.

*   `DELETE /<table_name>/<record_id>`: delete a specific record from the table `table_name`.

*   `GET /<table_name>`: read information about the table `table_name`.

*   `GET /<table_name>/<record_id>`: get a specific record from the table `table_name`.

*   `GET /<table_name>/_all_records`: read all records from table `table_name`.

    There are two optional parameters:
    
    * `limit`: limit the query to a given number of records;
    * `skip`: skip a given number of records.
